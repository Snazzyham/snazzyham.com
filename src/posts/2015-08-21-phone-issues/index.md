So in about 2 weeks it's going to be my Galaxy Nexus' 1 year anniversary. Yes I am aware that the GNex released 2 years ago and I bought the phone 2 weeks before the launch of the Nexus 4 (I was impatient, needed a new phone). For the past couple of months I've been having major issues, the phone was fine, installed a custom rom and after a while it got too buggy and laggy. So I went back to stock, it was fine for about a week or two and started getting major lag issues once more. I've repeated this process a lot of times and I get the same results. 

People (well my parents mostly) say I tinker with my phone to much. Well that's the reason I bought an Android phone, to play with it! I've heard of people doing majorly insane shit to their phones and it always works fine for them, no matter what ROM I run, what kernel I use, my phone always seems to lag. 

So now it's time for a new phone, I thought I had decided what I wanted but I still am not too sure. I'm pretty much set on the Sony Xperia Z1. Why? The three things that matter in a phone to me personally have been fulfilled. Excellent Build Quality? Check. Good camera? 20.7 megapixels of Check. Performance? in the name of the Snapdragon 800 I pronounce you Checked. A major plus is that it's water proof, So I don't have to spend cash on that GoPro I've been hankering for. The only issue I feel I might have with this phone is Sony's software. Which actually doesn't really seem that bad anymore, once you throw in a nice launcher and 3rd party apps, you can replicate the stock experience. I could also root it and run a custom ROM but something tells me that ROM's are not going to be able to take full advantage of that camera. 

The other option I had was to go with the Xiaomi Mi3. You probably don't know what that is. Well Xiaomi is a chinese phone manufacturer much like Oppo, and they sell high end phones at lower prices than the likes of the bigger name brands. The Mi3 has all the latest specs; 1080p, 13MP, great build quality and even gives you the choice between a Snapdragon 800 and Tegra 4 chip. Which is nice. And with the Mi3 I wouldn't mind running a custom ROM if it's gonna be as supported as the Oppo Find 5 (you can run custom rom's without having to root the phone). But in order to avoid making the purchase and there not being support for the device, I'm currently installing MIUI v5 (the Xiaomi OS) on my GNex to see if it's bareable. I've tried it before but didn't like it. 

Now you're going to say "Goddamit man you're messing up your phone" well hey, it's already messed up and I needed to refresh it anyway. 

UPDATE: Been running MIUI for a while, review is up on [YouTube](http://youtube.com/technocastle69) and I'm really liking the performance of it.
