Hey you, yes, you there. you see this blog you're reading this post on? Does it look different? It does doesn't it. Previously, it was on a dark grey background, with white text. I really liked it, but a lot of people didn't. So I thought, why not try going back to my old white & green colour scheme. The thing is, my CSS was a mess. So, instead of catching up on lectures last night, I decided to re-factor my entire CSS as SCSS. 

The first time I had tried using SCSS was on the new Percolate Galactic website, and I loved how much faster it made everything. To be honest, I'm not even using it to its full potential. I use SCSS for two main reasons, Nesting and Variables. With variables, I don't have to keep copying and pasting my colour code, which has saved me an insane amount of time, also, if I ever want to test a different colour scheme out, I just need to change one line of code. 

However, probably the thing I used most for this website, was nesting. I never actually learned CSS properly like through a course or whatever, so I'm still not confident when it comes to _"change the colour of all the links within this div only"_, and with nesting it makes that so much easier. I used this a lot because I wanted my links on my masthead and footer to look different to body links. 

Long story short, SASS / SCSS is really really good, and I can see myself using it on a lot more projects from now on.
