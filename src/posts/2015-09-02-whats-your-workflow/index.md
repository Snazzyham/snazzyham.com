Everyone has their own workflow for getting stuff done, be it developing websites, writing an article or anything else; like getting an assignment done (which I probably should be doing right now). In development terms, this commonly refers to your process of working on a project.

When it comes to developing a website, here's how my workflow goes now. If it's a CMS reliant project, I install that CMS locally first on my computer, set everything up, build the site in Atom and make changes in Chrome DevTools' Inspect Element pane until I find the change that works then copy those to over to Atom before I ftp them over to the server. Yes, I know there's a much more efficient way to do this, even replacing Atom completely with DevTools, but there's quite the learning curve to getting everything set up and I'm still getting to that. 

For plain HTML sites, I pretty much do the same thing except I've gotten so used to just doing the edits directly in Atom and then refreshing to see if worked (since it works faster compared to working on CMS files as the CMS needs to be refreshed). I've been reading up on DevTools over the past few days, and was thinking of porting my entire workflow over to DevTools, until about 5 minutes ago. 

I was [reading this article on techcrunch](http://techcrunch.com/2015/09/01/mozilla-relaunches-its-thimble-online-code-editor-for-teaching-html-css-and-javascript/?ncid=rss&utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29&sr_share=facebook) about this tool called [Thimble](https://thimble.mozilla.org/) that Mozilla developed to aid in the "code education" sector, so I decided to take it for a spin. Although it seems super simple and barebones, I actually really like Thimble and feel like it would be a great tool to use when updating static HTML sites and what not, thanks to it's live updating feature. I know Bracket's does something similar (in fact, this is built on Brackets I think), but I think this could be a great tool for quick changes and edits and I'm looking forward to giving it a shot. 

Another thing that interests me is that this could be really great for a chromebook user, ironic given it's a mozilla product.
